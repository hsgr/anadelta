Anadelta (Greek: ανάδελτα) means inverted delta and is the name for the algebraic symbol of nabla (or del).

This repository includes all source files designed in freecad and roughly based to [kossel designs](https://github.com/jcrocholl/kossel) to built a delta style 3D printer using 20x20 aluminum extrusions and φ10mm smooth rods.

The firmware is [Marlin](https://gitlab.com/zisi/marlin/tree/anadelta-1.1.8)
